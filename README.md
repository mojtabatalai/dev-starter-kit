"Create a vibrant, eye-catching billboard design for an agricultural store named 'Talayi Agricultural Inputs & Pesticides'. Use bright, energetic colors and a modern, clean illustration style. Include bold Farsi text saying 'فروشگاه سموم و نهاده‌های کشاورزی طلایی'. Add illustrated elements like fertilizer bags, spray bottles, pesticide containers, seeds, crops, wheat, and green leaves. The overall mood should be professional, colorful, and highly attractive to farmers. Big bold title, smooth gradients, dynamic shapes, and a sunny agricultural background. Ultra-sharp, high contrast, perfect for outdoor advertising."

“ethos guide sensei vibe”
dude breaks down ethos like he’s been livin inside the system for years
every guide he drops feels like someone finally turned the lights on

honestly feels like havin a mentor who wants you to actually win
rare energy on x
Do you prefer Discord or Telegram for starting a new group?
umi moves like something meant to happen slow quiet inevitable like destiny
“always two steps ahead”
talk to him for five minutes and you realize he’s already thinking about problems you haven’t noticed yet
he predicts issues before they show up and gives fixes before things break
that’s leadership energy even if he doesn’t call it that
Do you already have a specific industry in mind?
